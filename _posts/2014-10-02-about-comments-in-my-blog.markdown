After first post, I was considering to add [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) module for comments on my blog. I followed guidelines to configure and install it, but, unfortunately, the comments didn't show up. After few hours, I finally find two scripts, [cout.js](a.disquscdn.com/count.js) and [embed.js](a.disquscdn.com/embed.js), can not be loaded in China because of [GFW](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Firewall_of_China). I probably will try to look for a substitute later, if I can find one not been blocked.
