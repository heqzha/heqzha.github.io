Today is my first day working at aceme-medical. It is very exciting to meet with new colleagues and work in new environment. In the morning, my boss briefly introduced the project and assigned the specific work for me. I am mainly responsible for the development of medical application for Android platform, which includes designing a MVC architecture, communicating with cloud and medical devices, data analysis and processing, etc. The short term mission for this weeks are:

1. Read codes and docs of current version.
2. Draw a diagram for the MVC architecture.
